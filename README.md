acting for or on behalf of, targetedcountries. These lists of individuals are sanctioned individuals that our clients maynot want to do business with.https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdn.xmlThe XML list above provides an XML list of OFAC consolidated sanctionedindividuals.

## Instructions
Build an API with Spring Boot that fetches this XML list at 12AM daily-Save this list to a Postgres database table for each individual entry
Create an API endpoint to return a list of these individuals. This APIendpoint must be paginated i.e. 
should accept skip and limit parametersused to query the database for a particular page and size.
Notables:-Truncate postgres table whenever the list is updated daily. This is so that wecan always keep an updated version of the SDN list
